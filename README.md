# Next Word Predictor using Bidirectional-LSTM

Welcome to the Next Word Predictor project! This repository demonstrates a powerful deep learning approach for natural language processing using Bidirectional LSTM networks. The project is designed by showcasing modern tools, techniques, and features in NLP and deep learning.

## 🚀 Features
- **Bidirectional LSTM Model**: Leverages advanced sequence modeling for accurate next-word prediction.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes Keras Tokenizer and padding for robust input handling.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily swap in your own text data via a `.txt` file.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Uses `to_categorical` for multi-class classification.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Includes training, validation, and performance metrics.
- **Prediction Demo**: Interactive next-word prediction loop for real-world testing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📦 Services & Libraries
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural network API.
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computations.

## 📚 Techniques
- **Sequence Padding**: Ensures consistent input length for LSTM.
- **Tokenization**: Converts text to sequences for model input.
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Captures context from both directions in text.
- **Categorical Crossentropy Loss**: For multi-class prediction tasks.

## 📝 How to Use
1. Place your training data in `faqs.txt` (one sentence per line recommended).
2. Run the notebook: `Next Word Predictor using Bidirectional-LSTM Project.ipynb`.
3. Train the model and test predictions interactively.
